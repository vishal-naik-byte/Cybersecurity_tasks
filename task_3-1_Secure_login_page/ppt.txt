Slide 1: Project Title

Title: Flask Login Page with Secure Authentication

Subtitle: A simple, secure login page built using Flask with a modern design.

Image: Optional (e.g., Flask logo or a screenshot of the login page)



---

Slide 2: Introduction

Objective: To build a simple and secure login page using Flask.

Key Features:

Secure login functionality (username & password).

Password field hidden (input masking).

Flash messages for login success or failure.

Beautiful design with modern CSS.




---

Slide 3: Project Structure

File Structure:

/project
  /templates
    login.html
  app.py

app.py: Contains Flask app logic and routes.

login.html: Contains the login form and front-end design.




---

Slide 4: Flask Backend (app.py)

Flask Setup:

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash
app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'

User Credentials:

Dummy user data: Username = 'user', Password = 'password123'.


Login Route:

Handles GET and POST requests.

Checks the entered credentials.

Redirects with a flash message on success or failure.




---

Slide 5: Front-End Design (login.html)

Login Form HTML:

A form with username and password fields.

A submit button to trigger login.


Styling:

Centered login form.

Gradient background.

Smooth hover effects on buttons and input fields.


Flash Messages:

Success and error messages displayed with appropriate colors.

"Login Successful" or "Invalid Credentials".




---

Slide 6: Code Example - Backend Logic

Display the relevant part of app.py for handling form submissions and validation:

if request.method == 'POST':
    username = request.form.get('username')
    password = request.form.get('password')
    if username == USER_CREDENTIALS['username'] and password == USER_CREDENTIALS['password']:
        flash("Login Successful!", "success")
        return redirect(url_for('home'))
    else:
        flash("Invalid Credentials", "danger")
        return redirect(url_for('login'))



---

Slide 7: Code Example - Front-End (login.html)

Display the relevant part of login.html:

<input type="text" id="username" name="username" class="input-field" placeholder="Username" required>
<input type="password" id="password" name="password" class="input-field" placeholder="Password" required>
<button type="submit" class="btn-submit">Login</button>

CSS for Design:

Display key styling snippets to show how the form is made visually appealing.




---

Slide 8: Project Demonstration

Screenshot of the running login page.

Show login success and failure messages.



---

Slide 9: Testing and Results

Test Cases:

Test with valid credentials (Login Successful).

Test with invalid credentials (Invalid Credentials).


Browser View: Screenshot of successful login or failure.



---

Slide 10: Security Considerations

Password Masking: Password is hidden when typed.

Session Management: Flash messages are used for feedback after form submission.

Storing Passwords: In production, use hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt).



---

Slide 11: Future Enhancements

Integrate a database to store user credentials securely.

Add email verification and password reset functionality.

Improve security with CAPTCHA to prevent bot logins.

Style improvements for mobile responsiveness.



---

Slide 12: Conclusion

Summary: We have built a simple yet effective login system using Flask with a modern design and basic authentication.

Next Steps: Continue adding features and security enhancements.
