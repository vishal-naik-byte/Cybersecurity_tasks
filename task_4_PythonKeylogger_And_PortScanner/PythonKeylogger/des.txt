1. Have Authorization: Only use it on systems you own or have explicit permission to use.


2. Inform Users: Notify all users of the system that keystrokes may be logged for legitimate purposes.


3. Add Safeguards: Implement clear and secure logging mechanisms and data storage, ensuring compliance with privacy laws.



Below is an educational and ethical keylogger example built in Python. It uses the pynput library to capture keystrokes and save them to a file.

Installation

Install the pynput library using pip:

pip3 install pynput

Use a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

1. Create a Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv myenv

Replace myenv with your desired environment name.


2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

source myenv/bin/activate


3. Install pynput in the Virtual Environment:

pip install pynput


4. Run Your Script: Use the virtual environment's Python:

python keylogger.py


5. Deactivate the Environment (when done):

deactivate

How It Works:

1. Keystroke Logging: Captures every keypress and appends it to a log file.


2. Listener Control: Stops logging when the Esc key is pressed.


3. Log File: Logs are saved in keylog.txt in the script's directory.



Usage and Testing

Run the script in a terminal or IDE on your authorized system.

Type keys, and check keylog.txt for logs.

To stop, press Esc.


Important Notes

1. Use for Learning/Authorized Testing Only: Deploying this without explicit consent is illegal and unethical.


2. Secure Log Files: Implement encryption if storing sensitive data.


3. Notify Users: Transparency ensures compliance with ethical and legal standards.
